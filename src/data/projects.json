    "description": "Status Tracker challenged me to quickly debug a persistent 500 error in an unfamiliar codebase. I traced the issue to outdated dependencies and improved error handling, learning GraphQL, Prisma, and Next.js on the fly. The project sharpened my backend skills and taught me the value of robust debugging and clear communication.",
